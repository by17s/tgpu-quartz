# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the TGPU-quartz documentation! This guide will help you get started with the TGPU-quartz GPU architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of GPU architectures
- Familiarity with programming in C/C++
- Access to a TGPU-quartz simulator or hardware (if available)

## Installation

To install the TGPU-quartz simulator:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tgpu-quartz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tgpu-quartz
   ```

3. Build the Simulator:
   ```bash
   cd sim/
   make
   ```
4. Build the Compiler:
   ```bash
   cd tgpu-quartz-compiler/
   make
   ```
5. Verify the installation by running a test program (prints "Hello, TGPU-quartz!"):
   ```bash
   ./simulator -vram 16m -eu 1 -mem tests/sample_program.tgpu_hex
   ```
    Results should show successful execution without errors.
    `-vram`: Video RAM size  
    `-eu`: Execution Units count
    `-mem`: Memory image file

## Running Your First Program

Once installed, you can run a simple program using the simulator:

1. Create a new file named `hello.c`:
   ```c
    #include <tgpu_quartz_debug.h>

    int main() {
       // Example program
       debug_init(DBG_SERIAL, UART0, 115200);
       debug_log("Hello, TGPU-quartz!");
       return 0;
    }
   ```

2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   ./tgpu-quartz-compiler hello.c -o hello.tgpu_hex
   ```

3. Run it with the simulator:
   ```bash
   ./simulator -vram 16m -eu 1 -mem hello.tgpu_hex
   ```

This will execute your program and display any output generated by it.
